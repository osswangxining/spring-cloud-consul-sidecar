This project provides Consul integrations for Spring Boot apps through autoconfiguration
and binding to the Spring Environment and other Spring programming model idioms. With a few
simple annotations you can quickly enable and configure the common patterns inside your
application and build large distributed systems with Consul based components. The
patterns provided include Service Discovery, Control Bus and Configuration.
Intelligent Routing (Zuul) and Client Side Load Balancing (Ribbon), Circuit Breaker
